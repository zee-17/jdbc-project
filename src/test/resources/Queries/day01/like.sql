-- display all employees where first_name startswith B
select * from EMPLOYEES where FIRST_NAME like 'B%';


-- WRONG LOGIC
  --> it says give all info name starts with B and length is 2

-- display all employees where first_name startswith B and lenght of it 5 letter
select * from EMPLOYEES where FIRST_NAME like 'B____';


-- display 5 letter first names from employees  where middle char is z

select * from EMPLOYEES
    where FIRST_NAME like '__z__';
-- NOTE ---> Values are CASE SENSITIVE
---> KEYWORDs/TABLEs/COLUMNs  are NOT CASE SENSITIVE


-- display 5 letter first names from employees ending with e
select * from EMPLOYEES
where FIRST_NAME like '____e';

-- it gives all firstnames ending with e



-- display firstnames where second letter is a
select * from EMPLOYEES
    where FIRST_NAME like '_a%';

-- display all employees where job id contains IT
select * from EMPLOYEES
where JOB_ID like '%IT%';
