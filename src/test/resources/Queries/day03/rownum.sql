select * from employees;


/*
 it limits rows based on provided number
 */

select * from EMPLOYEES
where rownum<11;


--display all information from employees who is getting first 5 highest salary

-- BAD PRACTICE
-- It is getting data before order them based salary and
-- cut the list from line 6 then it tries to order them between first 5 rows
-- That is why we are getting WRONG LIST
select * from EMPLOYEES
where rownum<6
order by salary desc ;

-- CORRECT ANSWER
select * from (select * from EMPLOYEES order by salary desc )
where rownum<6;


-- display all information who is getting 5th highest salary
--display all different salaries in desc order
select distinct salary  from EMPLOYEES order by salary desc;

-- display 5th highest salary
select min(salary) from (select distinct salary  from EMPLOYEES order by salary desc)
where rownum<6;



-- who is getting 5th highest salary
select * from EMPLOYEES  --2                        --1
where salary = (select min(salary) from (select  distinct salary  from EMPLOYEES order by salary desc)
                where rownum<6);
                   --3



-- IQ -->  display all information who is getting 213th highest salary
--  display all information who is getting 4th highest salary

select * from EMPLOYEES
where salary = (select min(salary) from (select  distinct salary  from EMPLOYEES order by salary desc)
                where rownum<5);

select  max(SALARY) from (select distinct SALARY from EMPLOYEES order by SALARY asc)
    where ROWNUM <4;

select distinct SALARY from EMPLOYEES order by SALARY asc;



-- HOMEWORK -->  display all information who is getting 3th lowest salary
select  max(SALARY) from (select distinct SALARY from EMPLOYEES order by SALARY asc)
where ROWNUM <4;
